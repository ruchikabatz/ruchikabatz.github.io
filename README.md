### Password Strenght Checker

This project includes a Python- based password strenght checker. It uses the file '10k-most-common.txt' from the [SecLists repository] (http://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) to identify weak passwords.

#### Features:
- Check if a password is part of the 10,000 most common passwords.
- Evaluates password strenght based on lenght and complexity.

####Note
The password list is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in productionor or for critical applications.
